This directory contains all source code of the TRLAN package.

Makefile.gcc      - the gfortran makefile, a template for compiling the souce code
Makefile.intel    - the intel fortran makefile
dsort2.f          - a simple sorting routine
dstqrb.f          - a program copied from ARPACK to compute the
                    eigenvalues and the last row of the eigenvectors of
                    a tridiagonal matrix
restart.f90       - a file contain all restarting procedures
trl_comm_none.f90 - the same procedures as in trl_comm_mpi.f90 without
                    actually calling MPI (it is used to be used on
                    sequential machines.)
trl_info.f90      - this file contains two modules one defines the
                    TRL_INFO Fortran 90 derived type and the public
                    interfaces of the pacakge (trl_interface)
trlan.f90         - all subroutines with public interface are in this
                    file
trlan77.f90       - the Fortran 77 wrapper for TRLAN (can be called
                    from C)
trlaux.f90        - some I/O functions and printing functions used in
                    TRLAN
trlcore.f90       - the bulk of the code that performs arithmetic
                    operations
